/*
Description: This program simulates a simple resource management game where the player must manage Energon cubes. The player can generate and sell stacks of Energon cubes, monitor their Energon balance, and make decisions based on market trends and production costs. The goal is to accumulate 1,000,000 Energon by the end of the game.
